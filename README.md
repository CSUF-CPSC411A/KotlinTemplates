# Kotlin Templates for Mobile Apps
This repository provides templates for various components used in Kotlin-based mobile app development. 

## How to use the templates
1. Inside each template you will see these markers to indicate what you should modify to customize it: `/*< Description >*/`.
1. Remove the entire marker and replace with the appropriate code based on the description. For example, you can replace `class /*< Class name >*/ { ...` with `class Users { ...`.
1. You will also find `TODO` items that help guide you in completing the template. The descriptions will help you identify what should go in the specified part of the code.

## Template list
1. [RecyclerViewAdapter.kt](RecyclerViewAdapter.kt) - Used to control how each element in a RecyclerView is displayed.
